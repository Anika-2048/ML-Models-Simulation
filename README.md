# ML-Models-Simulation
This project simulates 4 ML models on a simple 2D dataset. Points inside a unit circle are one class; outside points are another. A 3-layer MLP and a Transformer are separately trained for classification. A Diffusion model and a GAN are separately trained to generate points from one class (i.e. inside the circle). This project is built as an assignment to understand the architectures and working of these models.
