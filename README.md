# ML-Models-Simulation
This project simulates 4 ML models on a simple 2D dataset. Points inside a unit circle are one class; outside points are another. A 3-layer MLP and a Transformer are trained for classification. A Diffusion model and a GAN are trained to generate points from one class. This is built to understand the architectures and working of these models.
